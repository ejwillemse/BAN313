title       : Case study 6 - Different applications of probability distributions
description : In this case study we will analyse data for different process outputs, and see whether the outputs can be modelled as specific probability distribution. The distribitions that we will analyse are normal, poisson and exponential, power-law, and uniform. After eye-balling the applicable distribution we will answer find the appropraite distribution parameters, using the data, and then empirically answer some basic planning decisions using the appropriate distribution with its parameters.
