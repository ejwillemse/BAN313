title       : Case study 7 - Fitting probability distributions and estimating distribution parameters
description : "In this case study we revisit the examples from Case study 6, where we analysed data for different processes, and eyeballed the data to see if the processes can be modelled using specific probability distribution functions. In this case study we will use formal methods to test if a distribution is appropriate, using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. We will also use boot-strapping methods to estimate model parameters."

## Background

In this case study we will revisit the examples of [Case study 6: Different applications of probability distributions](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/industrial-analysis-using-r/10161) and use formal methods to test whether the processes can be modelled using specific probability distribution functions. We will further use bootstrapping techniques to estimate model parameters.

## Drill-hole sizes

We wish to replace our current very old drilling machine.
The machine is required to drill a hole with a diameter of 10cm within 0.5cm tolerance.
If the hole is larger than 10.5cm, the part has to be scrapped.
Similarly, if the hole is smaller than 9.5cm the part will also be scrapped.

We also want to use the machine to drill holes for other products that have different tolerances.
One product may have a 0.25cm tolerance, another 1cm.

We have identified a possible replacement machine, and its supplier assured us that it will perform according to specifications.
We insisted that the supplier provide us with data on its performance, so that we can make a more informed decision on whether it will meet our requirements.

The supplier has given us data on different holes drilled by the machine during its testing.
The data consist of a number of drill samples, with the hole diameter for each hole measured and captured.
The data is available in the `holeSize` dataframe.

For the first part of this question, analyse the distribution of hole sizes from the machine and identify the distribution that best describes the hole-sizes from the machine, find it's key parameters from the sample and using R's built-in function, use the _distribution_ (not the sample data) to find the probability of a hole drilled by the machine to fall outside a 0.30cm tolerance limit.

*** =instructions

1. Analyse the distribution of the hole-sizes using the `hist()` function and by playing around with the `breaks` parameter.
2. Determine the key parameters of the distribution (note that this part is not checked for correctness).
3. Using the distribution (not the sample data), calculate the **probability** of a hole drilled by the machine to fall **outside** a 0.30cm tolerance limit, and will therefore be defective. Assign your answer to `pDefective03`.
4. View the value of `pDefective03` by printing it to the console output via the `script.R` file.

*** =hint

Use `hist(holeSize$holeDiameter_cm)` to analyse the distribution and see which of the four distributions

* normal,
* poisson and exponential,
* power-law,
* uniform, or
* $t$-distribution,

it most closely represents.

Use the appropriate function from the following to calculate the probability of a hole falling outside the 0.30cm tolerance limit:

```
pnorm, ppois, pexp, punif, pt.
```
Remember that outside the tolerance means the hole is either smaller than 10 - 0.3cm **or** bigger than 10 + 0.3cm.

## Drill-hole: goodness-of-fit for the uniform distribution part 1

The first distribution that we are going to test is the uniform distribution, even though we are certain that the drilling holes do not follow this distribution. Knowing the answer in advance is useful when mastering new techniques since we can easily check if the answer from our techniques make sense.

We will first perform the goodness-of-fit test by manually calculating the $\chi^2$ value of our sample, compared to the expected uniform distribution.

Recall that for the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test we work with bins, and compare the number of observed cases in each bin with the expected number of cases should our variable follow a certain distribution. Importantly, for continuous data we need to decide on the number of bins. We can do so by drawing a histogram of the variable, using the `hist` function, and then change the number of breaks in the histogram. Even better, by assigning the histogram to an object, R can automatically return the number of observations for each interval, thus we don't have to do it manually. The following code illustrates this process:

```
h <- hist(someVariable)
h$counts # this gives the number of cases in each bin of the histogram
hCounts <- h$counts # now we can use the number of counts.
```

Using the above code we can change the number of breaks in the histogram, assign the histogram to $h$ and use `h$counts` to get the count per bin.

To calculate the $\chi^2$ value we can use the following formula:

$$\chi^2 = \sum\_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(O\_{i}-E\_{i})^2}{E\_{i}}$$,

where $k$ is the number of bins, $O\_{i}$ is the observed number of cases in bin $i$ and $E\_{i}$ is the expected number of cases in bin $i$ for the expected distribution.

Once we have our $\chi^2$ value we can calculate the probability of getting this value, or greater, using `pchisq(q, df, lower.tail = FALSE)` which takes as input the $\chi^2$ value, `q`, degrees-of-freedom, `df, and wether the lower (left) or upper (right) tail value should be returned. For the $\chi^2$-test the upper tail value should be returned, hence `lower.tail = FALSE`.

If the probability of getting the $\chi^2$ value is very small, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence that the variable *DOES NOT* follow the expected distribution. If $\chi^2$ is big, we say there is not sufficient evidence to discard the distribution.

Using the data available in the `holeSize` dataframe, complete this question do the following:

*** =instructions

1. Draw a histogram of the hole-size and set the number of breaks to 9 (this should give you a histogram with 10 bins).
2. Redraw the histogram bust this time assign it to the object `h`.
3. View the object `h` to make sure that it is the histogram with 10 bins.
4. View the number of observations in each bin of the histogram by printing `h$counts` to the console.
5. Assign the number of observations in each bin to `hCounts`.
6. Since we assume that hole size will follow a uniform distribution, how many cases do we expect in each bin? Hint: first determine the total number of cases, then calculate how many cases do we expect to be in each of the 10 bins. Assign your answer to `expectedCount`. Do not round your answer.
7. Using `hCounts` and `expectedCount`, calculate the $chi^2$ value and assign your answer to `chiSqr`. Hint: the following R formulate can be used `sum((hCounts - expectedCount)^2/expectedCount).`
8. Calculate the degrees-of-freedom for the test and assign your answer to `df`.
9. Calculate the $p$-value for the test and assign you answer to `p`.
10. View the `p` value and decide for yourself whether the null-hypothesis for the test should be rejected.  Your answer should be either `TRUE` for _we reject the null hypothesis_ or `FALSE` for _we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis_. Assign your `TRUE` or `FALSE` answer to the `rejectH0` variable.

*** =hint

If you don't know how to calculate the chi-squared value or the degrees-of-freedom, review _Section 3.3: Testing of goodness of fit using chi-square (p.134)_ of the prescribed textbook by Diez et al (2014). Thereafter carefully go through all the background and instructions.
