**After completing the above, read the below instructions carefully.**

In this lab we will look at the same examples from Case study 6, and do the following:

1. Estimate confidence intervals for key distribution parameters using the bootstrapping method.
2. Use the R functions of the distribution to calculate percentiles and probabilities as required.

Some of R functions that are applicable to this chapter are:

```
dnorm(), pnorm(), qnorm(), dpois(), ppois(), qpois(), dexp(), pexp(), qexp(), dunif(), punif(), qunif(), dt(), pt(), qt()
```

To find out more about the functions, type `?function` in the R console. The basic usage of the functions is described in [this page](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/probability.html).

Take note that the data used for this chapter is randomly generated and will change:

- each time the chapter is attempted; and
- when moving from one exercise to the next.

When completing the chapter, read all the available information and instructions _carefully_, and if necessary, review the applicable engineering statistics methods.

## Estimating key parameters for Drill-hole size distribution

We wish to replace our current very old drilling machine.
The machine is required to drill a hole with a diameter of 10cm within a 0.5cm tolerance.
If the hole is larger than 10.5cm, the part has to be scrapped.
Similarly, if the hole is smaller than 9.5cm the part will also be scrapped.

We also want to use the machine to drill holes for other products that have different tolerances.
One product may have a 0.25cm tolerance, another 1cm.

In the chapter we formally tested the goodness-of-fit for the normal distribution, and found that due to the large $p$-value of the $\chi^2$ test statistic we cannot reject $H\_0$, which is that hole-size follows a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation equal to that of the sample data. If we were to repeat the question with a new sample, we would get a different sample mean and standard deviation, even though the process output follows the same distribution.

Ideally we would like to calculate confidence intervals for the distribution parameters, and thereby make our analyses of the process output more robust. In this question we will do exactly that by using bootstrapping to calculate key distribution parameters.

The basic component of bootstrapping is as follows. Using the sample data we will do the following:

1. Sample from the sample data with replacement. The number of samples from the sample will be equal to the original sample size.
2. Calculate the parameters of interest on the sample of samples.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times and capture the key parameters of interest each time. Each sample from the sample can be considered a simulation, or a bootstrap.
4. Statistically analyse the distribution of the parameters captured over the multiple runs of step 3.

The following R functions will come in handy when doing bootstrapping:

```
rep(), for(), sample(), quantile()
```

When using `sample` we can set `x` to the original sample variable that we are analysing, from which we will now sample, and `n` to the number of samples in the original sample since we want to sample the same number of times. Importantly `replace = TRUE` so that sampling is done with replacement, otherwise we will just end up with an identical sample to the original. For more information on the functions, use the `?function` command.

For this question we will perform 1000 simulations (bootstraps) and analyse the distribution of the mean and standard deviation for the drill-hole size.

To complete the question, do the following:

*** =instructions

1. View the mean and standard deviation of `holeDiameter` by printing their values to the console. You do not need to assign the values to anything. Just print and view it.
2. Using the `sample` function take a random sample with replacement from the hole-size samples and assign the results to `holeDiameter_boot`.
3. View the mean and standard deviation of `holeDiameter_boot` by printing their values to the console. You do not need to assign the values to anything. Just print and view it and compare it to the mean and standard deviation of the original sample.
4. Use the `rep` function to initiate a vector consisting 10000 `NAs` and assign it to `holeMeans`.
5. Use the `rep` function to initiate a vector consisting 10000 `NAs` and assign it to `holeSD`.
6. Use a `for` loop and repeat the `sample` function to take a sample with replacement from the hole-size samples 10000 times. In each execution of the `for` loop you can assign the results to `holeDiameter_boot_test`. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `holeDiameter_boot` and store the results in the appropriate `i` position of `holeMeans` and `holeSD`. Hint: if you are unsure how to do this, have a look at the [Probability](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis/lab-2-probability?ex=1) and [Foundations for inference: Sampling distributions](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis/lab-3a-foundations-for-inference-sampling-distributions?ex=1) datacamp chapters.
7. Draw histograms of `holeMeans` and `holeSD`.
8. Use the `quantile` function to calculate 95% confidence intervals for `holeMeans` and `holeSD` using the `quantile` function and assign the results to `meanInter` and `sdInter`. Hint: for the mean hole-size the code will be `meansInter <- quantile(holeMeans, prob = c(0.025, 0.975))`
9. View `meanInter` and `sdInter` by printing their values to the console.
10. For a worst-case scenario we can use the `holeMeansInter` value that is the furthest away from the required drill hole size of 10cm, and the `sdInter` value that is the largest. Using the appropriate two values, calculate the probability of a hole falling *outside* a tolerance limit of 0.5cm. For the calculations, use `holeMeansInter` and `sdInter` directly by calling either `holeMeansInter[1]` or `holeMeansInter[2]`, depending on which can be considered as the worst-case option, and the same with `sdInter`. Assign your answer to `pDefective05`. Do not use the values displayed in the terminal. They are not accurate enough. Hint: use the `pnorm` function and remember that you will have to call it twice.
11. View the value of `pDefective05` by printing it to the console.

## Gautrain arrival rate: parameter estimation using bootstrapping

In the previous chapter we analysed Guatrain arrival rate per minute. We formally tested the goodness-of-fit for the poisson distribution and found that we cannot reject $H_0$. We can therefore model the number passenger arrivals per minute, $X$, using a poisson distribution, such that:

$$X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda),$$

where $\lambda$ is the expected (mean) number of arrivals per minute. For the goodness-of-fit test we estimated $\lambda$  using the sample data, but if we got a new sample, we would get a different expected number of arrivals per minute, even though arrivals follow the same poisson distribution.

Ideally we would like to calculate confidence intervals for the arrival rate, and thereby make our analyses of the arrivals more robust. In this question we will do exactly that by using bootstrapping to calculate the arrival rate.

Approximately _three_ passengers can go through Gautrain access gate per minute. The Gautrain wants to know how many access-gates should be in operation. The main constraint is that the probability of the access-gates not being able to process all the passengers arriving during a minute should be less than 0.05. We need to determine the number of access gates to ensure that the probability of the access-gates being insufficient to deal with the arriving customers during a minute is less than 0.05.

To answer the question we will do the following:

1. Calculate 99% confidence interval for the expected arrival rate per minute, $\lambda$, using the bootstrap method.
2. Use $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ by setting $\lambda$ the upper-limit of the confidence interval to calculate the 95$^\text{th}$ percentile of the number of customers arriving per minute, refer to as $X\_{95}$. This means that 95\% of the time, less than $X\_{95}$ customers will arrive per minute, meaning there is a 5% chance that more than $X\_{95}$ customers will arrive per minute.
3. Lastly we will use $X\_{95}$ and the given information that three passengers can go through a gate per minute to determine the number of required gates.

The arrival rate per minute of passengers between 16:00 and 18:00PM for the previous 30 working days can be found in the `nArrivePerMin` vector.

The instructions for the question are as follow:

10. Calculate the minimum number of gates required using the 95$^\text{th}$ percentile and the information that a single gate can process _three_ customers per minute. Remember to round your final answer-up. Assign your final answer to `nGates`.
